        <h4>Political Influence Distribution Among Major Coalition</h4>
        <p>
            The results of Malaysia's 15th General Election shows significant changes in the political landscape. 
            The Peninsular Malaysia became a battleground for the three major coalitions which are <b style="color: red;">Pakatan Harapan</b>, <b style="color: blue;">Barisan Nasional</b>, and <b style="color: green;">Perikatan Nasional</b>.
            <b style="color: red;">Pakatan Harapan</b> showed strong support along the <b>west coast</b>, attracting many voters in urban areas. While <b style="color: green;">Perikatan Nasional</b> in other hand dominated the rural area, especially in the <b>north</b> and <b>east coasts</b>. In contrast, <b style="color: blue;">Barisan Nasional</b> struggled, managing to hold onto only <b>Negeri Sembilan</b> and <b>Sabah</b>, which highlights a shift in voter preferences.
            In East Malaysia, the situation was different. <b style="color: purple;">Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS)</b> gained a significant majority in <b>Sarawak</b>, strengthening its position in the region.

        <h4>Seats by Coalition</h4>
        <p>Malaysia's 15th General Election marked a historic moment as it resulted in a <b style="color: red;">hung parliament</b>, with no coalition securing the simple majority of 112 seats needed to form a government. 
           This situation led to negotiations, as each coalition looked for support from the others. In the end, <b style="color: red;">Pakatan Harapan</b>
           succeeded in forming a government with with the support of all other coalitions and parties, except for Perikatan Nasional, which became the only opposition coalition.

        <h4>Voter Density</h4>
        <p>
            The map shows a <b>high density</b> of voters along the <b>west coast</b> of Malaysia, especially in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, and Penang. <b>Northern</b> Malaysia has a <b>moderate density</b> of voters, while <b>East Malaysia</b> has a <b>lower voter density</b>. 
            This suggests that there might be a need to adjust the number of parliamentary seats in these areas to make sure each vote carries more equal value, ensuring fair representation for all.

        <h4>Demographic Statistics</h4>
        <p>A large segment of Malaysia's voters is <b style="color: coral;">below 50 years old</b>, making it important for the government to focus on policies that appeal to this group. By addressing key issues like jobs, education, and healthcare, 
            the government can strengthen its relationship with younger voters and maintain its political power.
            Additionally, considering the country's ethnic composition, with the majority being <b style="color: steelblue;">Bumiputera</b>, it is essential for the government to also safeguard the interests of this community to ensure widespread support.
